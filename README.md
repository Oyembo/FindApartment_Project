APARTMENT FINDER 
This is a web application designed to help users find and manage property listings, with features for residents to view properties and for caretakers to manage them


Here is an example of a POST request body for creating a new user:

```json
{
  "name": "Hawi Gweth",
  "email": "hawi@jaber.com",
  "user_type": "Tenant"
}

The users will have a unique profile that will allow them to interact with what they have to offer; units or tenancy
